# Modeling-the-Poverty-Percentage-in-Indonesia-Using-the-Ridge-Regression-Method

Indonesia, despite its rich cultural diversity and natural resources, continues to face significant poverty challenges across its provinces. This research aims to model the factors influencing poverty levels using ridge regression, a method chosen due to high correlations among the independent variables.

The analysis found that variables such as the Open Unemployment Rate (TPT), Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP), education level, smoking, and mobile phone usage significantly impact poverty rates. Ridge regression demonstrated superior performance based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) measurements. The study's findings are intended to inform efforts to reduce poverty in Indonesia.
